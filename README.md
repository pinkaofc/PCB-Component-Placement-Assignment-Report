# PCB-Component-Placement-Assignment-Report
This project implements a constraint-based 2D packing algorithm to optimally place five rectangular components on a 50Ã—50 PCB grid. The solution satisfies all hard constraints including edge placement, proximity, parallel alignment, center-of-mass balance, keep-out zone avoidance, and non-overlapping boundaries. Using Python and matplotlib.
